FUNCLIB DOCUMENTATION

ABOUT FUNCLIB:
   FuncLib stands for Function Library, and is a complex collection of user created functions
    to make programming for the PSP easier. It was originally created by Sleepy under a different
    project name, but it was eventually changed to what it is now. This could not have gotten this
    far without the help of the people below. It is also meant to be a customizable library, so if
    you want any functions adjusted to suit your tastes then go ahead and change it!


USAGE:
   As you may have noticed more time has been spent on the development of funclib than the documentation,
    while this is not necessarily a good thing it tends to happen to a lot of spare time projects.
    In order to learn how to use funclib it is best to view the samples and the sparsely documented headers.
    The documentation folder would also be a good start too.


CONFIGURATION:
   You may go into the funcLib folder, and you can edit flConfiguration.h in order to configure funcLib,
    but if you wish to edit any of the included source files, please be sure you know what you are doing as
    big problems can arise due to dependencies.

UPDATES:
   Of course there will be updates, most will be large updates containing small and large changes alike.
    To find the latest updates, there are a variety of places to check for
    the newest files. Here are just a couple sites to check:

   1) FuncLib home: http://funcLib.juliusparishy.com/ 
   2) PSP-Programming: http://www.psp-programming.com/forums/
   3) SleepyPSP: http://www.freewebs.com/SleepyPSP
      I will add any others that decide to start hosting the project, but until then these are 
      safe bets.

   This is a community project, so if you update one of the files for your own personal use please
    share the changes with us. This will grow a lot faster with the help of the community, also if
    you have a module that you think could fit into funcLib well then don't hesitate to contact us.
     Flatmush: flatmush@hotmail.com
     Sleepy: sleepy@sleepypsp.com
     Other: funcLib@gmail.com
     IRC: freenode.net -> #psp-funcLib

   Also please check the TODO.txt document for further information on what will be added in the future,
    as well as known bugs that are to be fixed and ongoing todos.

FURTHER DOCUMENTATION:
   Check the currently incomplete doxygen for further information, or check the header files themselves.

CONCLUSION:
   Thanks for reading, and please enjoy the project!
