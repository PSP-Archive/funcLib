funcLib Beta Readme for 1.0.1

- The Beta folder contains demos that were not completed or are just generally very simple. Some of them were made
  for laughs and can serve as pretty good demos.

  - CaveRunner: An oddly colored 3D tunnel that you can fly through. That's about it.
  - flFlasher: Basically intended as a joke but used to test funcLib, this was just left to sit around.
