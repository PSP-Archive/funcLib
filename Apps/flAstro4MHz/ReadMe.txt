Created for funcLib 1.0.1

                - Instructions -

INSTRUCTIONS:
   The aim of this game is to land your spaceship as close to the center of the red, green, or blue colored landing pads.
   Bonus points are awarded for landing quickly, landing softly, landing close to the center and using fuel efficiently.
   As the levels progress gravity starts to become more of an issue, as does the rocky terrain and damage recieved from bumps.

   There are three difficulty settings:
      Easy:   This is more of a training mode, skilled players will quickly tire of this.
      Medium: Most players should play this mode.
      Hard:   This mode adds more to all areas of difficulty, aswell as adding in wind.



CONTROLS:
   DPAD LEFT/RIGHT - Thrust left/right.
   DPAD UP/DOWN    - Navigate menus.
   CROSS           - Normal thrust / Menu select.
   CIRCLE          - Hyper thrust / Menu back.
   START           - Pause menu.
   SELECT          - Take screenshot.




UNLOCKS:
  There are two unlocks that can be gained from playing well in medium and hard mode. You will be notified when you have recieved them.



HINTS/TIPS:
   -Try only saving your game when you intend to quit, saving and reloading for infinate lives gets frustrating even if it makes the HiScores easier to beat.
   -You can crash even on the landing pad if you land with too much force.
   -It is possible to land on the ground, however it is considered a crash if you run out of fuel and aren't landed correctly.
   -The landing multiplier is affected by 2 things, how hard you land and how close to the center you are.
   -It is nearly impossible to get 100% for either multiplier, but try to get as high as possible.
   -Try to land quickly for a good time bonus, as well as the fuel bonus.
   -On hard levels keep the lander high up until you are above the landing pad, then descend slowly.
